<img src="man reciting quran.jpg.jpg" alt="a man reciting quran" style="height: 700px; width: 750px;">





<p> Quran is a book that every Muslim aspires to memorize by heart, 
      but memorization requires long hours of effort and patience throughout the journey.
     However, the real challenge is not memorizing the Quran but rather remembering it throughout one’s life.
</p>

<p>   While this may seem like a very difficult task, there are some strategies you can adopt to remember all the
     verses you memorize.
</p> 
<p> If you are wondering how to memorize Quran and never forget it throughout your life, 
      then you are in the right place. First and foremost, in this article, we will shed light on the reasons
       why people forget the Quran. Next, we will discuss some of the most affordable ways to learn the Quran, 
       which you can use to remember it for a lifetime, In Sha Allah.
</p>
<img src="What-are-the-benefits-of-reciting-Quran.jpg" alt="Quran" style="width: 700px;" >
<h3 id="sec">What causes people to forget the Quran?</h3>
    <P> The most common cause behind people forgetting the Quran is that they do not revise often. 
You should revise each verse you memorize repeatedly if you intend to remember it for a long time.</P>
     
    <P> Also, non-Arab Muslims typically have difficulty remembering the Quran due to language barriers.
           Because non-Arabs are rarely aware of the meanings of the sentences, 
           they tend to mix up verses with one another and then forget the Quran completely. 
           This scenario also relies heavily on revising the lessons on a regular basis.</P>
     
    <H3 id="trd"> What is the easiest way to memorize Quran and never forget it?</H3>
<img src="kids_reading_quraan_together-1-600x450.jpg" alt="two kids Reading-Quran" style="width: 700px;">
<p>The answer to the question ‘How to memorize Quran and not forget’ is within a few simple methods one 
      can adopt when learning the Quran.</p>

<p>Before we move into the methods, let’s clarify that one must have their obligations in place when beginning 
      to memorize the Quran. For instance, you should try to pray five times a day and stay away from anything 
      that is prohibited in Islam. Moreover, make sure you utilize your spare time effectively and do not indulge
       in activities that are not essential.</p> 

<p>Listed below are several Quran memorization techniques that you can follow if the question
       ‘What is the easiest way to memorize the Quran’ pops up in your mind.</p>
<h4>1.   Set a minimum goal</h4>
<p>If you do not set a goal and have no idea about how much you should memorize in a day, 
      then you are going to be extremely disorganized. It is very important to set objectives and have guidelines 
      so as not to get distracted.</p>

<p>It’s important to also stick to a habit, which means that you shouldn’t miss days. Just as if you were setting
       a daily goal or a weekly goal, you must achieve them. The process of memorizing the Quran won’t be convenient
        for you unless you stay consistent.</p>

<h4>2.   Figure out your personal learning technique</h4>
<p>Every individual’s learning technique is different. For instance, some people follow rote learning,
       which means that they are able to learn the verses automatically if they repeat them. Some people are 
       auditory learners, meaning that listening and hearing help them learn better. There are also visual 
       learners who need to see what they want to learn in order to retain it for a longer time.</p>

<p>Since everyone has their own learning technique, it is essential to discover your own, so you can memorize 
      the Quran faster and better.</p>
<h4>3.   Pick a time</h4>
<p>Your choice of time for your Quran learning plays a major factor in how well you memorize it. 
      According to many scholars and huffaz, the early morning is the best time to memorize the Quran.</p>

<p>Dawn is considered to be the best time to memorize the Quran as it is the time of Barakah (divine blessings). 
      The prophet (PBUH) said: “O Allah, bless my nation early in the morning”  [Sunan Ibn Majah] Additionally, 
      it is a time when our mind is the most refreshed.</p>

<h4>4.   Recite it</h4>
<p>Remember, it is imperative that you revise the Quranic verses that you memorize as much as possible.</p>

<p>Once you have memorized a few verses or pages, then start reciting them. It is best to recite it to somebody else,
       whether it’s a teacher or a friend. You can also start reciting the verses you learn in your salah. For instance,
        if you are praying a Sunnah prayer or a Nafal prayer, recite the passage you just memorized.</p>
<h4>5.   Stay in the company of the Quran.</h4>
<p>This is one of the most important Quran memorization techniques that you should consider following.</p>

<p>There are two possible interpretations of the phrase ‘Staying in the company of the Quran’. First of all, 
      you must associate with those who talk about the Quran or who are huffaz themselves. 
      Such people are going to keep you motivated, which as a result, will help you learn the Quran better.</p>

<p>Also, you should be listening to the Quran regularly from your favorite reciter in order to memorize the verses 
      efficiently.</p>

<h3 id="fth">How long will it take to memorize the Quran?</h3>
<img src="hand watch.jpg" alt="hand watch with Quran" style="width: 700px;">
<p>As we mentioned earlier, each person is capable of learning in their own way. 
      Age also plays a significant role in determining how long will it take to memorize the Quran?</p>

<p>Typically, an average individual takes about 2 to 3 years to memorize the Quran by heart. 
      It can also take longer if you are not well-aware of the Arabic language already. 
      However, some people also memorize it within a year, but it takes a lot of consistency and hard work.</p>

<p>Don’t forget that each letter of the Quran you repeat while memorizing it is a reward for you, 
      and it will be given to you on the day of judgement.</p>

<h3 id="ffth">Is it compulsory to memorize the Quran?</h3>
<img src="timthumb.jpg" alt="man reciting in sun lightning" style="width: 700px;">
<p>Quran is perhaps the only book that is memorized by billions of people all around the globe.</p>

<p>Memorizing the Quran is a highly praised act, and the Huffaz are rewarded with countless blessings by Allah Almighty, 
      but it is not compulsory for every Muslim to memorize the Quran by heart.</p>

<p>However, it is essential for every Muslim to recite at least a few surahs in Salah. 
      It is also important to thoroughly read the Quran and understand its message, 
      and the best way of doing so is by reading the Quran with its understanding. 
      There are several online platforms dedicated to helping individuals understand the message of the Quran.</p>
